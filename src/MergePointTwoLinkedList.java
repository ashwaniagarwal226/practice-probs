    /*Given pointers to the head nodes of linked lists that merge together at some point, find the Node where
    the two lists merge. It is guaranteed that the two head Nodes will be different, and neither will be NULL.
    In the diagram below, the two lists converge at Node x :
      [List #1] a--->b--->c
                    \
                     x--->y--->z--->NULL
                    /
         [List #2] p--->q

    Complete the int FindMergeNode(Node* headA, Node* headB) method so that it finds and returns the
    data value of the Node where the two lists merge.
    Input Format
    Do not read any input from stdin/console.
            The FindMergeNode(Node*,Node*) method has two parameters, and , which are the nonnull head Nodes of two separate linked lists that are guaranteed to converge.
